pwol is a command line utility to send Wake-On-LAN (WoL) packets to one or many hosts, either 
locally or via routers, in order to wake them up from sleep mode. 

It can also be used as a WoL proxy daemon listening to incoming WoL packets (possibly authenticated) 
and then forwarding requests to one or many other targets.
