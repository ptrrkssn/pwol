pwol is a command line utility to send Wake-On-LAN (WoL) packets to one
or many hosts, either locally or via routers, in order to wake them up
from sleep mode. 

It can also be used as a WoL proxy daemon listening to incoming WoL
packets (possibly authenticated) and then forwarding requests to one
or many other targets.
